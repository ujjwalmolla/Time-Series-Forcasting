# Time-Series-Forcasting
A time series-based regression dataset, that has 21 input features and 1 target variable. Each
check point represents the number cycles that have been rented from that particular
checkpoint on the corresponding date and target is the sum of number of cycles that have
been rented on that particular date. In addition to that you are also provided with weather data
of the particular city. Also all the check points are in a single city for which weather data is
provided.
You need to analyse following mentioned points;
1. EDA on the data i.e. handling anomalous values, insights, etc.
2. Implement any of the deep learning based algorithms to achieve a good MAPE, and Error
performance.
3. If required you can use auto hyper parameter tuning algorithms along with the deep
learning algorithms.
